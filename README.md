# Final Project

> [Teams Project Board](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-7-8-projects/projects/1)  
> [Starter Code](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/organized-for-deployment)

In the upcoming 6 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created and deployed a full-stack web application. Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is more important than coding! If you don't organize as a team it doesn't matter how good you are at coding individually, the project will never come together

## What we expect from you

This module is about much more than just the code. It's also about planning projects, structuring your development process, and working collaboratively.  This module is also the final assessment for you time at HYF.  We'll be watching you!

But what will we be watching for?

- Participation on Sundays
- Active communication on Slack
- Wednesday check-ins
- Small, well-named commits
- Disciplined branching & merging
- A clear development strategy
- Good use of issues, projects, PRs, ...

## What you can expect from the module

So that's what we expect from you, but what can you expect from yourselves?

We'll provide you with the starter code, but it's up to each team to decide what to make of it.  (We'll work with you to make sure that your ideas are possible ;).   Teams can build the same project working in parallel to find different solutions, or each team can build a different project.

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
- How to work in a `Scrum setting`

## The Schedule

The project module will take 6 weeks.  There are 3 different phases to the project:

### Week 1

In the first week you will become familiar with the starter repository and plan the overview of your project.  This weeks objectives include:

- Define your user stories
- Write a first-draft development strategy
- Begin planning the data tables for you application
- Begin wireframing
- Setting up the starter project
  - Add each other as collaborators
  - Set up the project board

### Week 2

In this second week your team will work on coordinating your development for the remaining 5 weeks.  This includes:

- Filling your project board with a backlog of tasks
- Defining milestones for the coming weeks
- Defining a communication plan
- Setting up the Database
- Deploy the starter code

### Weeks 3, 4, 5

Sprinting.  Standups, backlogs, tickets, code reviews ... all the fun stuff.

### Week 6

Feature Freeze!  Put the finishing touches on whatever you have working and get ready to present your project at graduation. This includes:

- Making sure your deployed app works for the live demo
- Preparing a presentation where everyone in your team will speak
- Building a static landing page for your project
- A short video add for your project, something you might see before a youtube tutorial

## Checking In

Because your teams are mixed with class 7 & class 8 students, we will use this repo as your home base for the final project.  Wednesday check-ins will be here as well as the teams project board.

Each team will host their code and main project board in a team repo.  You'll use that project board to organize your development.

The project board in this repository will be used to track the overall progress of all the teams. Coaches and HYF core team will come here first to see how each team is doing and how we can support you.  Each final project group will create 1 issue for their entire team and place it on the board in this repository. There is a template issue to get you started.
